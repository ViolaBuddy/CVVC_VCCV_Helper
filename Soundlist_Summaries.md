# Chinese CVVC

This is the easiest of these three languages to understand, since it's exactly Pinyin:

- Initials: b p m f d t n l g k h j q x z c s zh ch sh r y w
- Finals: a o e i u v an ang en eng yong ai ei ou er (v is interchangeable with yu; remember that iu and ui are simply contractions for iou and uei)

The main syllable has standard pinyin of the entire syllable (possibly including a "medial," an additional i or u before the actual final as in "guai"). This main syllable, after a rest, should start with a hyphen-space instead ("- bang")

The connecting syllables have the final of the previous syllable and the initial of the next syllable, with a space in between ("a bang"). Before a rest, use "R" as the initial; before a word with a null initial, just use the final instead (e.g. [-bang][ang a][a][a R] for 帮啊). 

Some changes to the final syllables occur (mainly to disambiguate them):

- zi/ci/si -> -i
- zhi/chi/shi/ri -> h-i
- ong -> yong

# French CVVC & VCV

French is my native language however please take this with a grain of salt.

Notes:
- W strings together with a
- 8 strings together with i

# English VCCV

This is a little more complicated. Here is a list of the sounds:

- Consonants: f v p b m t d s z th dh sh zh n l r dd k g h hh j w y ng nk sk sp st sm sn (note that j, ch, and the s* blends are treated as a single sound, even if they are consonant clusters. hh is used instead of h before E and y sounds. ng and nk is only at the end of a syllable)
- CCV consonants: bl fl gl kl pl sl spl br dr fr gr kr pr tr shr skr spr str thr sf dw kw gw sw tw vw skw thw by dy fy gy ky py my ny vy zy sky spy
- VCC consonants: bd bz ft fts fs gd gz ks kt kst ps pt vz vd zd znt cht chz ts dz jd dhd sht ths md mf mfs mp mps mpt mz ngz nk nks nkth sk st sts sks skt nd ns nt nts nz nj njd nch ncht nth lb lf lk lp ls lt lv lz lch lsh lth

And the vowels are:

- Pure vowels: a e i u E o 6 9 @ x 0 (o as in boot, 6 as in book, @ as in bat, 9 as in ball, x as in the, and 0 as in oar)
- Diphthongs, r-colored, and nasalized vowels: A I O 8 Q & 1 3 (8 as in bout, Q as in boy, & as in hand, 1 as in ink, 3 as in heard)

There can only be one vowel per note, and one starting consonant sound before and one ending consonant sound after it. However, simple consonants or CCV consonants can be used to start the syllable, and simple consonants or VCC consonatns can be used to end a syllable.

Connecting notes from a syllable that ends with a vowel to one that begins with ac

A note after a rest is denoted with a hyphen without a space ("-ha"). A note before a rest is denoted with a trailing hyphen without a space ("ar-")

\* combining notes are \_l \_r \_w and \_y (and \_X for all vowels X)

## Vowels:

- Pure vowels: a e i u E o 6 @ x
- Diphthongs: A I O 8 Q
- Nasalized and r-colored vowels: & 1 3 \*9 \*0
- Syllabic consonants: nn mm ll nng

\* 9 and 0 are pure vowels, but in American English they are generally only followed by a liquid or nasal (9l, 9m, 9n, 0l, 0r), though in certain dialects of English (those without the caught-cot merger, i.e. people who pronounce "caught" and "cot" differently), the 9 vowel can be used on its own ("cot" would be spelled "kat" and "caught" would be spelled "k9t").
\* the syllabic consonants are a little weird in that they can be used on their own; however, in the case that you want it to follow another consonant (as in the ll sound at the end of "apple"), you can just treat it as the schwa x followed by the consonant ("apple" would become @pxl), since the "pll" sound is not one that's included in VCCV.

## Blending notes:

All vowels also have forms with \_l, \_r, \_w, and \_y before them (e.g. for the vowel a, we have \_la, \_ra, \_wa, and \_ya). They're used after CCV consonants ending with the corresponding letter. ("bla" -> \[bl\]\[\_la\])

There is also a blending note without any consonant before them (e.g. \_a).

## How they go together

In general, a syllable has the form \[starting consonant\]\[vowel\]\[ending consonant\]. The starting consonant is either a simple consonant (excluding the ending-only consonants), a CCV consonant, or empty. The vowel can be any of the vowels listed above (with the restrictions on the syllabic consonants as stated). The ending consonant is either a simple consonant (excluding the starting-only consonants and the inverted sonority hierarchy blends), or an ending VCC consonant, or empty. 

However, there are some English syllables that don't take this form exactly. "bulbs" for example can be split in starting-vowel-ending like this: \[b\]\[6\]\[lbz\], but the ending consonant "lbz" is not a single sound. We thus get four sounds instead: \[-b\]\[6\]\[lb\]\[bz\].

So let's make a little chart of how things go together. In the following, V is a vowel, C is any simple consonant, CCV is a starting blend, and VCC is an ending blend. First, a chart for how to deal with the onset of the syllable:

| syllable structure | what to do                                      | example                               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| V                  | put a single V                                  | "a" -> \[a\]                          |
| C - V              | put a single CV                                 | "sa" -> \[sa\]                        |
| CCV - V            | put a CCV followed by a \_CV                     | "swa" -> \[sw\]\[\_wa\]                |
| \[sf\] - V         | put a CCV followed by a \_V (???)                | "sfa" -> \[sf\]\[\_a\]                 |


And now a chart for dealing with the coda:

| syllable structure | what to do                                      | example                               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| V                  | put a single V                                  | "a" -> \[a\]                          |
| V - C              | put a V followed by a VC                        | "as" -> \[a\]\[as\]                   |
| V - VCC            | put a V followed by a VC- follwed by a VCC      | "aks" -> \[a\]\[ak-\]\[ks\]           |
| V - VCC - VCC      | put a V followed by a VC- then VCC- then VCC    | "alks" -> \[a\]\[al-\]\[lk-\]\[ks-\]  |

But slightly more complicated are how syllables interact with each other. In the following, in addition to the abbreviations used above, N is any consonant that's a liquid/nasal/semivowel (l, m, n, ng, r, y, w) while K is any consonant that is not, and H is any vowel that's a diphthong and X is any vowel that is not (including syllabic consonants)

| first syllable ending | second syllable beginning | what to do                                                          | example                                   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| (rest)                | C                         | add a dash before the start of the syllable                         | "R ta" -> \[R\]\[-ta\]                    |
| K                     | C                         | let both syllables remain as they are                               | "ak ta" -> \[a\]\[ak\]\[ta\]              |
| V                     | C                         | add a "V C" sound in at the end of the first syllable               | "a ta" -> \[a\]\[a t\]\[ta\]              |
| N                     | C                         | add an "N C" sound in at the end of the first syllable              | "an ta" -> \[a\]\[an\]\[n t\]\[ta\]       |
| (rest)                | V                         | add a dash before the start of the syllable                         | "R a" -> \[R\]\[-a\]                      |
| C                     | V                         | varies; see below                                                   | (varies)                                  |
| H                     | V                         | add a "HV" sound in at the end of the first syllable                | "Q a" -> \[Q\]\[Qa\]\[a\]                 |
| X                     | V                         | varies; see below                                                   | (varies)                                  |
| C                     | (rest)                    | add a dash after the end of the syllable                            | "ak R" -> \[a\]\[ak-\]\[R\]               |
| V                     | (rest)                    | add an additional V sound with a dash at the end of the syllable    | "a R" -> \[a\]\[a-\]\[R\]                 |

For X - V transitions, if the X is an E, you can usually add in a "y" sound ("E a" -> "E ya"). You can also sometimes get away with this insertion if the second vowel is E, but that's less reliable so double-check. Similarly, if the X is a o, you can add in a "w" before the the second syllable ("o a" -> "o wa"). If you're trying two other vowel combinations, though, your best bet is just to either end off the first syllable and start off the next one ("a O" -> \[a\]\[a-\]\[-O\]), which leads to an audible break between the syllables or try something with an underscore ("a O" -> \[a\]\[\_O\]).

For C - V transitions, you can often move the C so that it starts the second syllable instead of ending the first one, avoiding this issue altogether ("ak a" -> "a ka" -> \[a\]\[a k\]\[ka\]). In cases of N-type consonants, however, this is undesirable because we still need the N constant to color the previous vowel; we can simply duplicate the consonant and add an ending dash instead ("0r a" -> \[0\]\[0r-\]\[ra\] or \[0\]\[0r\]\[ra\]). The other option is to do add in a starting blend (underscore) to the V ("ak a" -> \[a\]\[ak\]\[\_a\])

By the way, for K - C transitions, the normal thing is to just leave them, but you can sometimes try out ending the first syllable with a dash. 

Another small trick: a glottal stop can be made by using a Vt- sound (e.g. "it" -> \[i\]\[it-\]). The t phoneme won't be produced if the sound is made short enough in UTAU. This trick may only work with certain voicebanks, however.

# CVVC English

TODO

This is Cz's 2012 CVVC English reclist (since there are a few other CVVCs out there - including VCCV English, but at least that one's named something different to avoid confusion). There are a few phonemes that are different:

| VCCV  | CVVC |
|-------|------|
| dh    | tth  |
| dd    | (missing; use d or t) |
| hh, h | h (same letter) |
| a, 9  | a (same letter) |
| O, 0  | O (same letter; you can also use the starting half of Q instead of 0) |
| x     | (missing; use u, 6, or another vowel) |
| yo    | yo, U (alternate spellings for the same sound; some voicebanks may only use one or the other) |

And the way it handles ending, blending, etc. consonants is different, too, and somewhat simpler: 

Every sound is either a vowel sound (\[-V\], \[V\], or \[V-\]), a CV sound (\[CV\] where C can be a simple consonant or a consonant cluster) or a VC sound (\[VC\] where again C can be a simple consonant or a consonant cluster). There is no distinction between the sound that comes at the end of a word and the sound that comes before a new word (in VCCV, there's a distinction between \[ar\] and \[a r\]), and all blends are recorded with all vowels, which makes it a bit easier on the UST maker:

| first syllable ending | second syllable beginning | what to do                                                          | example                                   |

| V                     | C                         | add a "VC" sound in at the end of the first syllable (note that if C is a consonant cluster, the VC only uses the first consonant of the cluster) | "a ta" -> \[a\]\[at\]\[ta\]               |
| (rest)                | V                         | add a dash before the start of the syllable                         | "R a" -> \[R\]\[-a\]                      |

| C                     | (rest)                    | nothing special                                                     | "ak R" -> \[a\]\[ak\]\[R\]                |
| V                     | (rest)                    | add an additional V sound with a dash at the end of the syllable    | "a R" -> \[a\]\[a-\]\[R\]                 |


# English Arpasing

Whereas VCCV is very fined-tuned to fit the quirks of English, Arpasing's notation is very generally applicable. Every note is either two sounds together (whether CC, CV, VC, or VV), or a sound starting or ending a phrase as denoted by a dash (-C, -V, C-, V-). There are also vowels by themselves, though you'll only very rarely use them. As a rule of thumb, every phoneme in your song will appear exactly twice, once at the end of one note and once at the beginning of the next note.

The tradeoff for this simplicity is that not all sound combinations are recorded. But exactly which ones are and aren't recorded will differ based on the specific rec list: there was an original rec list when Arpasing first came out, but Arpasing was designated not to be that specific rec list but the whole general pattern and naming convention. So because of these missing phoneme combinations, that rule of thumb I was talking about above (every phoneme appearing twice) is actually very much not true in practice: you'll have to work around all the sound combinations that don't actually exist in the specific voicebank that you're using.

One other thing about Arpasing is that it's designed with redundancy: common sounds will be recorded multiple times, so you have the option to add 1 or 2 or 3 at the end of the note name to get different recording takes. This is something you'll have to adjust manually if you want to take advantage of it.

But with those caveats out of the way, we can list out what all the phonemes are. Some are one letter and one are two, but there's no ambiguity because notes always have a space between phonemes, unlike in VCCV. Also, I'm grouping these into subcategories but Arpasing doesn't actually make these sorts of distinction (it barely even makes a distinction between vowel and consonant!), again unlike VCCV.
